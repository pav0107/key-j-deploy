# Key-J app

Key-J is an app to help DJs, musicians and music enthusiasts access a song's key information, such as danceability, energy, mood, tempo, time signature and, of course, key.

It was concepted and built by [Isobel Peppiatt](https://github.com/isobelpepp), [Matt Firmston](https://github.com/YoFirmy), [Luke Usher](https://github.com/lushcodes), [James Condon](https://github.com/JEC1100) and [Pav Rao](https://github.com/pav0107) as their final project at Makers.

It is deployed [here](https://key-j-app.herokuapp.com/).


## File structure

We had problems deploying the project so radically changed the file structure. For the original file structure and information on set up, running and testing, please visit this [repo](https://github.com/pav0107/key-j).
